Biography
======
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Seoul National University, South Korea.
I received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, South Korea, in 2010, 2012, and 2020, respectively.
Before the Ph.D course, I was with SK Hynix, South Korea, from 2012 to 2015.
My research interests include energy-efficient system for machine learning and brain-inspired (neuromorphic) computing.
